* JP Addison's Personal Configuration Files
Welcome to the repository where I keep my configuration files. This repository is going to be messy, and it's time I accept that. Not meant to be used without my context.
** Tools
As of 2020-08, I use vscode (with vim emulation) for my editor. bash in iTerm2 is my shell. I program primarily in TypeScript. My favorite editor from a UI perspective was spacemacs. I really want the ~<leader> key key~ pattern to catch on.
** Setup
Run `./newcomputer.bash` to set up symlinks and configurations on a new machine. This script will:
- Create symlinks for shell configurations (bash, zsh)
- Set up tmux and tmuxinator configurations
- Link git helpers
- Copy VSCode settings (macOS path)
- Set up PostgreSQL configuration
