* JP Addison's Personal Configuration Files
Welcome to the repository where I keep my configuration files.  Feel free to take whatever you find useful.  I try to comment these pretty liberally, so it should be pretty easy to follow.
** Spacemacs
Spacemacs is a great batteries included distribution of emacs.  http://spacemacs.org/
** Pure Emacs
I no longer use this file, but it is nice to keep as reference.
** TODO Move intellij files to sub-repo
