* JP Addison's Personal Configuration Files
Welcome to the repository where I keep my configuration files.  Feel free to take whatever you find useful.  I try to comment these pretty liberally, so it should be pretty easy to follow.
** Intellij
I use the IDE Intellij for editing now. It has it's own submodule so it can automatically sync it's settings.  ideavimrc is the only file I manually edit.
*** Submodules reading

** Spacemacs
Spacemacs is a batteries included distribution of emacs.  http://spacemacs.org/. Currently phasing this out in favor of Intellij
** Pure Emacs
I no longer use this file, but it is nice to keep as reference.
