# Global Claude Code Preferences

Testing to see if you can read this! Secret code: bananas

## bash-ing

- Use `trash` instead of `rm` to delete files / folders

## Git

- Prefer `git add -u` over `git add .`. Add individual files with `git add <file>`.
- Moving files in git is difficult to do while preserving history. Moves should be done in single commits with no changes to the file contents.
- Run `npm run format:write && git add -u` before committing

## Human coauthor info

- Hi! I'm JP. I've been web software dev for 5 years, with a break for 2 years until very recently. I was on only one codebase during that time, so my knowledge is a bit specific.
- I use TODO; to document things I want to do before submitting a PR. Generally if I ask for a TODO, I want it with a semicolon like that.
